# Our Journey interactive student journey creator

_Our Journey_ is an interactive online tool to chart the highs and lows of student journeys.

The aim is to produce a simple and accessible structure for students to represent
the events that occurred in their study and their experience of these.
It is being developed for use by all students and different institutions.
The design is informed by research conducted to understand the challenges faced
by disabled students at the Open University (see [Coughlan & Lister, 2018][ORO]
and [Coughlan, Ullmann & Lister, 2017)][ORO2]).

A physical version of the tool has been developed by [Tim Coughlan][tim] and
[Kate Lister][kate] of the Institute of Educational Technology (IET)
and Glen Darby in LTI Translation, with [HEIF funding][heif].

This prototype online version is being developed in the
Institute of Educational Technology (IET), at The Open University.

Author: [Tim Coughlan][tim], IET.
