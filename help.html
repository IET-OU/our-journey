    The Our Journey tool is designed to support you to represent a journey through studying. You can use it to talk about and reflect on the highs and lows of being a student so far, and what your goals are for the future. 
    
    <h2>Event cards</h2>
    A journey is created by producing cards that describe different events in the journey. Click on a card to focus on it (it should have a blue outline), then use the form to add or edit the following elements.

    Each card can contain:
        <ul>
            <li>An event: Pick the event item that best describes the type of event you want to include. There are lots of options. To get you started, ones that you might find at the start of a journey could include 'Considering study', 'Registering', or 'Finding information'.</li>
            <li>A description: You can add a short text description to each card to say exactly what happened.</li>
            <li>An emotion: How were you feeling at the time of the event? Pick the emotion that you feel best represents this from the range of options.</li>
            <li>An optional note: Some times you might want to say a bit more about what was going on, how you were feeling, or how these events fit together. Add a note to do this.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Creating the journey</h2>
    You can create cards for each memorable event and these combine to tell the story of your journey as a student. When you reach the end of the available cards on the page, clicking on the final arrow card will create more cards for you, up to the limit of 65.

    If you feel you want to reorder the cards, or make space to add in another event, you can use the 'Move back' and 'Move fwd' buttons to do this.

    <h2>Loading and saving your journey</h2>

    You can come back to your journey to add to it. 
    
    To save your journey, go into the options menu and find the 'File section'. Choose a file name, and click save. A small file will be downloaded to your computer that contains your journey.

    To load a journey, just click 'Choose file', find your journey file on your computer, select it to close the file browser, and then press the 'Load' button.

    <h2>Changing the view of the journey</h2>

    The view section of the options menu allows you to change the background colour, choose whether you want background images, and change the colour of the cards.

    <h2>Printing your journey</h2>
    
    You can print the journey using the built in browser print function. Use the 'Hide editor' button in the options so that it doesn't show the menus when you print. To avoid the print out taking several pages across, we find printing on A3 paper and scaling down the page to 80% of full size works best.
