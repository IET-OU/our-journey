    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    Our Journeys is an interactive online tool to chart the highs and lows of student journeys.
    <pg>
    The aim is to produce a simple and accessible structure for students to represent
    the events that occurred in their study and their experience of these.
    <br><br>
    It is being developed for use by all students and different institutions.
    <br><br>
    The design is informed by research conducted to understand the challenges faced
    by disabled students at The Open University.
    <br><br>
    We will shortly be releasing resources for journey-based activities alongside a fully working version of the online tool.
