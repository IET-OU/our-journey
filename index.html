    Our Journeys is an interactive online tool to chart the highs and lows of student journeys.
    <br><br>
    <b><a href='https://iet-ou.github.io/our-journey/tool/' >Try out the current version of the Journey Creator</a> (Currently only tested for compatibility with Chrome. There are known issues with Firefox).
    </b><br><br>
    The aim is to produce a simple and accessible structure for students to represent
    the events that occurred in their study and their experience of these.
    <br><br>
    It is being developed for use by all students and for use across all educational institutions.
    <br><br>
    The design has been informed by research conducted to understand the challenges faced
    by disabled students at The Open University, and workshops and discussions with a range of stakeholders across HE. 
    <br><br>
    Particular thanks to <a href="https://www.dnamatters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Diversity and Ability</a> for giving their energy and inspiration to this project.
    <br><br>
    HEIF Stimulating Knowledge Exchange funding has supported the early stages of this project. We will shortly be releasing resources for journey-based activities alongside a fully working and open licenced version of the online tool.
