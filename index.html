    Our Journey is a tool to support students to chart the highs and lows of their study journeys and the important events that happened along the way.
    <br><br>
    The aim is to produce a simple and accessible structure for students to represent the events that occurred in their study and their experience of these. It is being developed for use by all students and for use across all educational institutions.

    The design has been informed by research conducted to understand the challenges faced
    by disabled students at The Open University, and workshops and discussions with a range of stakeholders across HE.
