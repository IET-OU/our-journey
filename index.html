    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Our Journeys is an interactive online tool to chart the highs and lows of student journeys.
    <pg>
    The aim is to produce a simple and accessible structure for students to represent
    the events that occurred in their study and their experience of these.
    It is being developed for use by all students and different institutions.
    <br>
    The design is informed by research conducted to understand the challenges faced
    by disabled students at the Open University.
