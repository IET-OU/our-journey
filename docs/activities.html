    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <p>
        The principle behind the tools is to support students to represent and communicate the student journey from
        their own perspectives. This lends itself to several different activities, including as a means to feedback and
        dialogue with staff, and as a means to reflection on their approach and goals. Our understanding of this is
        evolving as we devise and trial different activities using the tools. We are very interested to see how others
        use them too.
    </p>

    <h2>Students and staff workshops</h2>
    <p>
        The printed posters and cards are designed for discussion and work well with small groups. The tools are very
        flexible.
        An approach that we have found useful has been for each small group to include a student who represents their
        journey using the tools. Staff can discuss this with the student during the process to gain insight, and can add
        additional notes to the journey representation with their reflections.

    <h2>Student reflection activities</h2>
    <p>
        A key point raised in the design process was the potential for the tools to engage students in reflecting on
        their journeys. This could be an individual activity, but journeys can also become a shared artefact for
        discussion with tutors or peers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The learning outcomes we suggest for these activities include to be able to:
    </p>

    <ul class="bodylist">
        <li>Communicate your experience of being a student.</li>
        <li>Reflect on the way in which they deal with challenges during study.</li>
        <li>Recognise and celebrate personal successes</li>
        <li>Recognise areas you found challenging and identify ways of overcoming similar challenges in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research and evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        The online or printed tool can be used as part of research conducted with students to understand their
        experiences. The use of the tool as part of an interview method is being piloted, and we are planning a trial
        where journeys are captured at scale as a means of feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>The journey as an interface for guidance and support</h2>
    <p>
        A more ambitious vision for the online journey tool is that it could become an active guide for students. For
        example, that they would periodically update it and receive support information based on their input.
