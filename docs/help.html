    <p>
    The Our Journey tool is designed to support you to represent a journey through studying.
    You can use it to talk about and reflect on the highs and lows of being a student so far, and what your goals are for the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Event cards</h2>
    <p>
    A journey is created by producing cards that describe different events in the journey. When you start, the first card will be open for you to work on it.
    </p>

    <p>Each card can contain:</p>
        <ul class="bodylist">
            <li>An event: Pick the event item that best describes the type of event you want to include. There are lots of different cards. To get you started, ones that you might find at the start of a journey could include 'Considering study', 'Registering', or 'Finding information'.</li>
            <li>A description: You can add a short text description to each card to say exactly what happened.</li>
            <li>An emotion: How were you feeling at the time of the event? Pick the emotion that you feel best represents this from the range of options.</li>
            <li>An optional note: Some times you might want to say a bit more about what was going on, how you were feeling, or how these events fit together. Add a note to do this.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Creating the journey</h2>
    <p>
    You can create cards for each memorable event and these combine to tell the story of your journey as a student. Click on any card to select it (it should then show a blue outline), then click again or press enter to edit it.
    When you reach the end of the available cards on the page, clicking on the final arrow card will create more cards for you, up to the limit of 65.
    <p>
    If you want to add a new card in between two exist cards, you can use the <b>'+'</b> button to do this.
    <p>
    If you want to reorder the cards, or make space to add in another event, you can use the <b>'<'</b> and <b>'>'</b> buttons to move the current card backwards or forwards.

    <h2>Keyboard navigation</h2>

    <ul class="bodylist">
    <li>Move through the cards using <b>TAB</b> to go forward and <b>SHIFT + TAB</b> to go backwards.</li>
    <li>Pressing <b>RETURN</b> will open the editor on that card.</li>
    <li>Once in the editor, you can TAB between the items and use the ARROW keys to select events and emotions.</li>
    <li>Pressing <b>ESCAPE</b> when in the editor will exit the editor so that you can move to a different card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Loading and saving your journey</h2>

    <p>You can come back to your journey to add to it if you save it.

    To save your journey, open 'Menu' and find the 'File' section.

    <p>
    First choose a file name, and click save. A small file will be downloaded to your computer that contains your journey.
    <p>
    To load a journey, first click 'Choose file'. Find your journey file on your computer in the file browser window that opens, select it to close the file browser, and then press the 'Load' button.

    <h2>Printing your journey and creating a pdf</h2>

    <p>
    You can print the journey using the 'Print' button in the file section. Most computers will provide the option to print to a pdf file as well as on paper. You may need to play with the settings to get the best output.


    <h2>Changing the view of the journey</h2>
    <p>
    The view section of the options menu allows you to change the background colour, choose whether you want background images, and change the colour of the cards.
