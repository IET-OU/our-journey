00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Angela>my name is Angela and this is my student
journey. I decided to register for a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.990
module with the Open University. It was
my first module and I wasn't sure where

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.929
I was gonna go from there. But I thought
well I'll give it a try. I must admit I

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.699
was really nervous at the start.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.870
It was maths my first module so it was
quite hard in some ways and but it was

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.470
also strangely confidence boosting. It
was interesting and we did stupid things

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.120
like singing songs about mathematics in
the bar and it was really good to sort

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.730
of have other people who I could talk
to about such a strange subject because

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.750
it's not a thing you talk about down the
pub with people very often in fact most

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.250
conversations go oh I'm terrible at
maths so and it was really nice to

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.870
actually be proud
of being good at it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.170
I was nervous about doing an exam in
mathematics which hadn't done for a very

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
long time and in fact when
I done maths before I'd

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
had a very bad exam experience so I was
quite nervous about at all and but I got

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.750
used to it and I started studying for
the exam and I got through it and I did

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.310
well enough not brilliant but well
enough and that was good so I felt quite

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.440
reassured that I could get through the
whole thing so that's how it started

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.800
and I got through my first module. Hooray!
and it was hard work but it was worth it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.250
very early on after going to the first
tutorial we decided to set up a study

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.510
group and I met with some other people.
That was really helpful because it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.960
didn't feel like anyone was judging you
when you were going along and meeting

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.180
with other people so there was a woman
who was Finnish and English was her

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.450
second language and she was learning
Spanish and I thought well she can do it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.590
and she's willing to try.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.890
Looking back I can see there were some
real high points for me. If I had to say

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.450
one particular one it would be working
with other students I think peer support

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.650
is absolutely essential I think it's one
of those things that really helps build

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.060
your confidence just having a laugh with
someone can just take away such a lot of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.430
tension and and feeling you're in a safe
space where people aren't going to judge

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.200
you and listening to the voice in my head
that said "yeah it's time to go back"

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.170
or "it's time to stop now you need a
break". That that was useful as well.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.579
It was a struggle when things were... the
material was hard or I wasn't confident

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.650
about the subject. But actually I felt it
was when your personal life got in the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.180
way that it was the biggest struggle
because it was really hard to get past

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.980
that and to remember that you could ask
for help. Asking for help wasn't easy but

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.840
once you got past that, everybody was
there to help you. The tutor, other

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.250
students, the student support people,
all really helped me when I got stuck.
