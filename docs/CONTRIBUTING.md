Hi,

We welcome bug reports and fixes, enhancements, pull requests, documentation and support from you.

Get involved!

And, thank you ;)

_This is a work-in-progress!_

[README][]

---

## Creating a bug report

 1. [Check if someone else has filed the same bug report][issues] previously. You can `+1` vote for it!
 2. Please [let us know the steps to re-create the problem][new], as much detail as possible;
 3. [Let us know what browser and operating system you're using][browser];
 4. Let us know if you're using assistive technology like a screen reader (name and version);
 5. A screenshot image can be really useful — [how to take a screenshot][screenshot].

## Creating an enhancement request

Please [explain your idea][new], and why you think it would be useful.
The more concrete you can make the use-case, the better.

_Note, we can't guarantee we'll put in loads of work — we aren't funded at this stage!_

## Creating a pull request

 1. Before you put too much work in, why not [talk to us about your idea][new]? (Say you're interested in contributing.)
 2. Fork the repository;
 3. Please look at the existing code, and try to make your code fit in (_unless our code looks really goofy!_)
 4. We have an [`.editorconfig`][editorconfig] file to help you match the coding style;
 5. You'll want `npm test` to pass before creating the pull request.
 6. And, make sure [you've set up your email address before you commit][config].

## And, other contributions

We welcome all contributions!

Feel free to write and edit documentation, share on social media ...!
